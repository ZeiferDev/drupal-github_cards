# GitHub Cards

This module provides placeable cards for GitHub user and repository information. 

There is no configuration required to use this module, but some custom styling may be needed to cleanly blend the card into your site. Once enabled, you can add GitHub Card entities and place them with blocks.

The functionality is inspired by the Unofficial GitHub Cards project by lepture.
