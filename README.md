# GitHub Cards

This module provides placeable cards for GitHub user and repository information.

There is no configuration required to use this module, but some custom styling may be needed to cleanly blend the existing styles into your site. The cards attempt to use your existing styles whenever possible, and this may or may not be desired. Once enabled, you can add GitHub Card entities and use them wherever you can normally use entities. The typical use case is to place them using a GitHug Card block.
